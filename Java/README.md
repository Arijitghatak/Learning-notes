# Java Basics Notes 📘

This repository contains **handwritten + structured notes on Java fundamentals**, compiled into a single PDF for **clear understanding, revision, and long-term reference**.

These notes are focused on **concept clarity**, not just syntax, and are suitable for:
- Beginners starting Java
- Students revising core Java before OOP / DSA
- Interview preparation at a basic–intermediate level
